I am going to pass you a list of activities able to be done in the video game Red Dead Redemption 2. I'd like to categorize the contents of these jobs so I can more easily create columns next to them in a spreadsheet adding metadata. Here's how we'll do it: You'll scan the contents of each job. You'll return to me a JSON of the form:

{
INDEX: ...,
JOB: .... ,
RAW_MATERIAL: (0 = no / 1 = no),
REQUIRES_WAGON: (0 = no / 1 = no),
REQUIRES_RECIPE: (0 = no / 1 = no),
IS_CRIMINAL: (0 = no / 1 = no),
IS_ACTIVITY: (0 = no / 1 = no),
}

Here's the definition of each category:
RAW_MATERIAL: Determines if the job involves raw materials (e.g., bank bonds, carcasses, chopped wood).
REQUIRES_WAGON: Determines if the job requires a wagon (e.g., crates of items, large deliveries).
REQUIRES_RECIPE: Determines if the job requires a recipe (e.g., boiled potatoes).
IS_CRIMINAL: Determines if the job is criminal in nature (e.g., bank bonds).
IS_ACTIVITY: Determines if the job is an activity (e.g., herding cattle, chopping wood).

For instance, you'd receive:
1 "Bring a Crate of 5 Bank Bonds to two stops."

Would output:

{
INDEX: 1,
JOB: "Bring a Crate of 5 Bank Bonds to two stops.",
RAW_MATERIAL: 1,
REQUIRES_WAGON: 1,
REQUIRES_RECIPE: 0,
IS_CRIMINAL: 1,
IS_ACTIVITY: 0,
}

Here's why: bank bonds (gold, moonshine, etc) are not civilian activities, they are criminal. Bank bonds are raw in RDR2, you find them in banks as is. Two travel to two stops with a crate you need a wagon. Is activity is 0 because the job isn't something like doing chores or herding cattle. Make sense? Here's an explanation of all the categories:
